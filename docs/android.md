# Android

`use android` brings `build_android` for apps and `build_android_library` for library modules.
They build Kotlin and Java like [build_kotlin](kotlin.md) and take its parameters from `compile_only` on, the test parameters included.

```kotlin
use android

repositories = list(google(), maven_central())

ui = build_android_library(
    "ui",
    "com.example.ui",                        // namespace
    list(
        platform("androidx.compose:compose-bom:2026.09.00"),
        "androidx.compose.material3:material3"
    ),
    repositories,
    plugins = list("compose"),
    directory = "ui",
)

app = build_android(
    "app",
    "com.example.app",
    list(ui, "androidx.activity:activity-compose:1.13.0"),
    repositories,
    plugins = list("compose"),
    version_code = 3,
    version_name = "1.2",
)
```

`build_android` builds a signed debug apk into `build/outputs/apk/debug/<name>-debug.apk`: resources with aapt2, Kotlin and Java against `android.jar`, dex with d8, and the Java resources, assets and native libraries of the app and of all its libraries.
`build_android_library` builds a library that apps use like an aar. `build-script build --release` builds for release, see [Release builds](#release-builds).

> The debug source set (`src/debug/...`) lies over `src/main`, like with the Android Gradle plugin.

## Release builds

A release build only happens on purpose: `build-script build --release` or `run --release`. The script only says how to build it, never whether. Tests always run against debug builds.

```kotlin
app = build_android(
    "app",
    "com.example.app",
    dependencies,
    repositories,
    proguard_files = list("proguard-rules.pro"),
    keystore = "release.jks",
    key_alias = "upload",
    keystore_password_env = "ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD",
    app_bundle = true,
)
```

```bash
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=... build-script build --release
```

What changes for release:

- The app is not debuggable, `BuildConfig.DEBUG` is `false` and `BUILD_TYPE` is `"release"`.
- `src/release` lies over `src/main` instead of `src/debug`.
- Native libraries are built by CMake as `Release`.
- R8 shrinks, optimizes and renames the code of the app and of all its libraries, then dexes it. The mapping of the renamed classes goes to `build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt`, all rules together to `configuration.txt` next to it. `minify = false` dexes with d8 instead.
- The apk is signed with the release key. Without a `keystore` it stays unsigned, `<name>-release-unsigned.apk`, and `run --release` refuses it.
- With `app_bundle = true` there is also an app bundle for Google Play, built with [bundletool](https://developer.android.com/tools/bundletool) and checked by its `validate`. It has one module, `base`, and the mapping, so Google Play shows readable stack traces. It is signed with jarsigner and the same key, without a `keystore` it stays unsigned too.

R8 gets its rules like with the Android Gradle plugin:

1. build-script's own, like `proguard-android-optimize.txt`
2. those aapt2 writes for the classes the manifest and the layouts name
3. `proguard.txt` of the aars and `consumer_proguard_files` of the library modules
4. the rules libraries keep in their jars, in `META-INF/com.android.tools` and `META-INF/proguard`
5. rules that keep the classes of `META-INF/services`
6. the app's `proguard_files`

The passwords stay out of the script, the logs and the process list: the script only names the environment variables, apksigner and jarsigner read them themselves.
A variable that is not set is an error.

## The SDK, devices and emulators

- An Android SDK in `ANDROID_HOME` is used when it is complete. Otherwise build-script installs what it needs into its own SDK, once its license is accepted: in the terminal, or with `accept_sdk_license = true`.
- `run` installs the app with `adb` and starts its launcher activity. With several devices `ANDROID_SERIAL` picks one.
- Without a device, build-script offers system images and sets up an emulator. `BUILD_SCRIPT_EMULATOR_ARGS` passes options to it, like `-no-window`.

## How the app is put together

- Library manifests are merged into the app's manifest. Entries with `tools:node="remove"` are left out, other `tools:` attributes are dropped.
- R classes are written like the Gradle plugin does it: one per package, with the ids of the app. A library may use resources only the app brings, references are checked when the app is linked.
- View bindings, BuildConfig and AIDL interfaces are generated like with the Gradle plugin.
- Libraries are dexed once and kept until one of them changes. Every build dexes only the own classes and those of the library modules.

## Tests

- **Unit tests** in `src/test` run on the JUnit Platform like those of [Kotlin](kotlin.md#tests). They compile against `android.jar`, whose methods throw `Stub!`: tests that call Android need a fake.
- **Instrumented tests** in `src/androidTest` run on a device. The module and its tests become one apk that instruments itself. An app keeps its application id, a library gets `<namespace>.test`. build-script uninstalls it afterwards. The tests run every time, the device is an input too.

```kotlin
test_dependencies = list("junit:junit:4.13.2"),
android_test_dependencies = list("androidx.test.ext:junit:1.3.0", "androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.7.0"),
```

> With the default runner, build-script adds `androidx.test:runner` when it is missing.
